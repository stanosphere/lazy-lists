# Lists

It never quite sat right with me that JavaScript doesn't really handle infinite lists. This is my attempt to solve this problem by making everything lazy with iterators.

This is still very much a work in progress.

## TODO
- Tests
  - unit test for each function
  - test composition
  - test laziness
